# Genetic-meta-analysis-on-RIF
Integrated analysis of multiple microarrays based on raw data identified novel gene signatures in recurrent implantation failure
# This is to identify robust differentially expressed genes and hub genes in endometrium associated with RIF, and to investigate the diagnostic role of hub genes in RIF.
